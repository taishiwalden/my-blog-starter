# Hi I'm Taishi üê®

I am passionate about business, digital product design, and software development. My skills are wide-ranging, spanning multiple creative and technical disciplines. I absorb information like a sponge and am constantly pursuing abilities that can help me develop into a well-rounded professional. src/posts/blog/images/about-img.png
