# Hi I'm Taishi üê®

I'm interested by emerging tech, art, and all things design. My skills are wide-ranging, spanning multiple creative and technical disciplines. I absorb information like a sponge and am constantly pursuing abilities that can help me develop into a well-rounded professional.

When I'm not behind my laptop, you'll find me weightlifting, hiking, hanging out with friends,  [taking photos](https://unsplash.com/@taishiwalden), or otherwise exploring the Pacific Northwest and beyond.
