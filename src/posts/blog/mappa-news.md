## Context

According to [Learning Theory Research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=587201), nearly 65% of the general population are visual learners, meaning they need to see information in order to retain it.

This prompted the creation of [Mappa](https://www.mappa.news/about): utilizing graphs, charts, maps, and other forms of visual stimulation to effectively illustrate current events and global news.

> The visual way to learn about global events and more

To measure the popularity of the project, I used Google Analytics to track web traffic, average time spent on the page, number of active users, as well as other key digital marketing indicators. I built a dashboard on Data Studio to allow for easy interpretation.
