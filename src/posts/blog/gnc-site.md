## Cafe Website

A local cafe needed a way to reach more customers and easily allow for people to order online.

> More than just coffee.

I was proud to manage the project with Good Neighbor Cafe on the development of their digital storefront. I was excited to take on this project for a woman-owned small business that operates a cafe in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Following the initial consultation with the client, I proposed a WordPress website that integrated the existing Point-of-Sale system [Clover](https://www.clover.com/) with an online ordering capability.

The team also created custom content (digital assets), as well as a Google My Business (GMB) integration to increase site exposure. I continue to work with Good Neighbor Cafe as their primary web and digital consultant.
