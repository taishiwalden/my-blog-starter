## Context

While legacy monolith architectures–like WordPress–have been a long-standing mainstay of many large organizations, development teams may find that the tightly coupled architecture and the use of legacy coding languages like PHP create more complexity and result in slow site performance.

I used this opportunity to migrate my web design's company website to a platform that also has powerful CMS and hosting features that WordPress has. Enter [Webflow](https://webflow.com/). Hosting our website on Webflow removed the requirement for monthly maintenance retainers that were associated with our old Wordpress site.

Not to mention, the old website lacked an aesthetic design and semantic layout necessary for a proper landing page. While it adhered to traditional website structure, it was time for a revamp.

## Task

Rebuilding a company website is no easy task, especially if you want to modify your brand messaging and create new digital assets. To start, we exported all of the appropriate text onto a document and began compiling our edits on the copy text. After defining the requirements for the new site's landing page and content, I created a basic layout of the website and redesigned it according to the [company colors](https://coolors.co/000814-2d00f7-0056e0-fafaff).
